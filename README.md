One of my school Contemporary World History projects.

**Project Description:** The recent history of Southwest Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa are one of
conflict and revolution. While the Western World has praised the Arab Spring, there are still many
unresolved issues. In this project, students will explore multiple perspectives surrounding one of these
ongoing conflicts: Israel and Palestine.

**Rationale:** Learning how to handle and resolve conflict is an ongoing process for us all. Whether you are
a government leader or a high school student, conflict resolution is an integral skill. The first and most
important step in conflict resolution is also the most overlooked: taking a step back and considering “the
other’s” point of view. Before we can successfully resolve a conflict it is essential to understand the
various perspectives involved.
